### 🤖 LLMs - Self-Improvement Technique

This article details a method for improving the performance of code Large Language Models (LLMs) through a self-improvement technique involving iterative pre-training and fine-tuning.  The process leverages pseudo outputs generated by the LLM itself to augment the training data.


Key Points:

• Improves code summarization capabilities


• Enhances code generation performance


• Utilizes pseudo outputs for data augmentation


• Iterative process for continuous improvement


• Leverages existing LLM knowledge for self-training



🚀 Implementation:

1. Pre-train & Fine-tune:  Initially train or fine-tune the code LLM on a base dataset.
2. Generate Pseudo Outputs: Use the trained LLM to generate example outputs.
3. Data Augmentation: Add the generated pseudo outputs to the original training data.
4. Retrain: Train the LLM again on the augmented dataset.
5. Repeat: Iterate steps 2-4 for further performance gains.

### 💡 Clean Code - Avoiding Common Mistakes

This article provides concise tips for writing cleaner code by addressing common control flow and conditional statement issues often encountered by programmers.  It focuses on improving code readability and efficiency.


Key Points:

• Avoid deeply nested if-else statements; use early exits when possible.


• Simplify complex conditional logic by leveraging the natural structure of return/exit statements.


• Utilize conditional expressions instead of manually returning binary literals.


• Employ conditional assignment for assigning values based on binary conditions.


• Consider automatic trailing whitespace removal tools to maintain code cleanliness.



🚀 Implementation:

1. Refactor nested if-statements: Analyze deeply nested `if-else` blocks and restructure them to use early `return` or `exit` statements where appropriate to improve readability and reduce nesting.

2. Simplify conditional returns:  Evaluate `if-else` structures where multiple conditions ultimately lead to a `return` or `exit`.  Streamline the logic by directly returning/exiting based on the condition.

3. Replace binary literal returns: Instead of manually returning `0` or `1`, use conditional expressions (ternary operator) to concisely represent binary outcomes.

4. Use conditional assignment:  For assignments dependent on a binary condition, employ conditional assignment (e.g., `value = True if condition else False`) for improved clarity.

5. Configure trailing whitespace removal:  Integrate a tool or IDE setting that automatically removes trailing whitespace during saving to maintain consistent code formatting.
